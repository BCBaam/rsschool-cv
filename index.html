      <h1>Short(no) story about myself. :)</h1>
      <article>Hello everyone! My name is Anton and im 23 years old. I was born and risen in Belarus,
      country of blue lakes and green forests. As almost every person I like to travel abroad,
      meet new people, enjoy new views, seas, mountains and beautiful cities. During my
      life different countries like Egypt, France, China and others. Most of them i enjoyed China,
      like county of another world. This place is never the same as any Europian country
      or country of Soviet Union. People there have their ovn culture, life style, even their own
      calendar! But enough about China. Im very kind and friendly person and ill be happy to meet YOU one day!
      Thanks for reading and have a nice day!</article>
